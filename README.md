The eventual goal of this repository is to have an up to date location for column/field definitions for database files used in World of Warcraft.

Project goals:
- Updated database definitions for all versions of World of Warcraft
- Human readable
- Machine readable

Cool stuff we might end up doing if this gets enough traction:
- Repository will feed automated updates on WoWDev.wiki
- Pull requests are automatically checked for validity

The format in which these files will be built up is still up for discussion. You can view the current proposal [here](https://wowdev.wiki/User:Marlamin/DB/Test) (Under the "Source struct" heading). Discussions regarding the format should be done in the relevant issue [here](https://github.com/Marlamin/WoWDBDefs/issues/1).

All feedback is welcome!
